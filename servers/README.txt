TODO: Write me up

just some basic terminology used through out the code:

* Build server: Server that builds and runs the code. This is installed on the user's machine.
    Currently, this will behave more like a client than an actual server.
* Mediator: The server that facilitates the communication between the iOS client and Build Server
* Backend: The communication between the build server and mediator
* Frontend: The communication between the mediator and iOS client
